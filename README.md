This code uses Flask to create a web application that accepts an Excel file containing email addresses and URLs. For each row in the Excel file, it checks whether the email address is valid by searching for the email address in the HTML response of the corresponding URL. If the email address is found in the HTML response, it is marked as "found on website." If the email address is valid, it is marked as "valid email." The results are saved in a new Excel file, and a summary of the results is displayed to the user.

Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the code:

The code imports the necessary libraries, including Flask, Pandas, requests, BeautifulSoup, and email_validator.

The code defines a function called "allowed_file" that checks whether a file is a valid Excel file based on its extension.

The code defines a Flask application and sets the UPLOAD_FOLDER configuration variable to the current directory.

The code defines a route for the root URL ('/') that accepts both GET and POST requests. For GET requests, it renders a template called "index.html". For POST requests, it checks whether a file was uploaded and whether it is a valid Excel file. If so, it reads the Excel file into a Pandas DataFrame, creates a list of responses and a list of email validation results, and loops over the rows of the DataFrame. For each row, it extracts the email address and URL, sends a GET request to the URL, and uses BeautifulSoup to extract the text of the HTML response. It then uses a regular expression to search for all email addresses in the text and loops over them. For each email address, it uses the email_validator library to check whether it is a valid email address and whether it can be delivered to. If the email address is found on the website, it marks it as such in the DataFrame. If the email address is valid, it marks it as such in the DataFrame and adds 1 to the mail_validation list. If the email address is invalid, it adds 0 to the mail_validation list. If the request fails, it adds -1 to the mail_validation list. After looping over all rows, it adds the mail_validation list and response list as new columns to the DataFrame, saves the DataFrame to a new Excel file called "Outputfile.xlsx", and calculates a summary of the results. It then renders a template called "summary.html" and passes the summary as a context variable.

The code defines a route for the "/download" URL that allows the user to download the output Excel file.

The code starts the Flask application on port 1234 with debug mode turned on.

Note that the code uses the tqdm library to display a progress bar while looping over the rows of the DataFrame. This is not strictly necessary, but it can be helpful when processing large Excel files.
